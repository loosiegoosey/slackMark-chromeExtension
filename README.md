## Usage Examples

Usage Examples
To use the SlackMark Chrome Extension:

1. Open any webpage in your Chrome browser.
2. Click on the SlackMark extension icon in the toolbar.
3. The extension will fetch the URL of the currently active tab and process it accordingly.

Here is a code snippet from `index.js` that describes the main functionality:

```javascript
var responseMessage = "...";

function handleExtensionPopup() {
    var url = null;

    chrome.tabs.query({
        active: true,
        lastFocusedWindow: true
    }, function(tabs) {
        var tab = tabs[0];
        url = tab.url;
        // Post Request to LS SERVER must be sent from here, as chrome.tabs.query is async 
        // and url var with valid data is not guaranteed outside. 
        // Outside this function, url might still be null.
    });
}
```

## Code Summary

Code Summary
The main functionality is contained in `index.js`:

- **`index.js`**:
    - Defines a `responseMessage` which likely serves as a template or a dynamic message component.
    - Contains the main function, `handleExtensionPopup`, that interacts with the Chrome API to query the active tab and retrieve its URL.
    - Ensures that the URL data is handled asynchronously to maintain data integrity and reliability.
